// In a particular factory a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who
// supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly
// bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Design a
// ShiftSupervisor class that inherits from the Employee class. The
// ShiftSupervisor class should have a field that holds the annual salary and a
// field that holds the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has
// earned. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and
// mutator methods for the class. Demonstrate the class by writing a program
// that uses a ShiftSupervisor object.
