// Employee and ProductionWorker Classes: Design a class named
// Employee. The class should keep the following information in fields:
// i) Employee name
// ii) Employee number in the format XXX-L, where each X is a
// digit within the range 0-9 and the L is a letter within the range A-M.
// iii) Hire date.
// Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator
// methods for the class.

// Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that inherits from the
// Employee class. The ProductionWorker class should have fields to hold the following information:
// i) Shift (an integer)
// ii) Hourly pay rate (a double)

// The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift will be an
// integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is
// shift 1 and the night shift is shift 2. Write one or more constructors and the
// appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class. Demonstrate the
// classes by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.

public class Main2 {
    
}
