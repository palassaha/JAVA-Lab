// In a particular factory, a team leader is an hourly paid production worker
// who leads a small team. In addition to hourly pay, team leaders earn a fixed
// monthly bonus. Team leaders are required to attend a minimum number of
// hours of training per year. Design a TeamLeader class that inherits from the
// ProductionWorker class. The TeamLeader class should have fields for the
// monthly bonus amount, the required number of training hours, and the
// number of training hours that the team leader has attended. Write one or
// more constructors and appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the
// class. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a TeamLeader
// object.
