// Design a Payroll class that has fields for:
// a) employee’s name
// b) ID number
// c) hourly pay rate
// d) number of hours worked. 

// Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods and a constructor that accept the
// employee’s name and ID number as arguments. The class should also
// have a method that returns the employee’s gross pay, which is calculated
// as the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly pay rate. Write a
// program that demonstrates the class by creating a Payroll object, then
// asking the user to enter the data for an employee. The program should
// display the amount of gross pay earned.

public class Payroll {
    
}
